## Assignment: Python List Operations

## Overview

This assignment involves performing various operations on a Python list, including appending elements, inserting an element at a specific position, extending the list with another list, removing an element, sorting the list, and finding the index of a specific value. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in basic list manipulation techniques in Python.

## Instructions

The following steps were taken to complete the assignment:

## Create an empty list called my_list.

Initialized an empty list using my_list = [].
Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.

Used the append() method to add each element to the list.
Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.

Used the insert() method to add the value 15 at index 1, making it the second element.
Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].

Used the extend() method to add the elements of [50, 60, 70] to the end of my_list.
Remove the last element from my_list.

Used the pop() method to remove the last element from the list.
Sort my_list in ascending order.

Used the sort() method to sort the elements in my_list in ascending order.
Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.

Used the index() method to find and print the index of the value 30 in the list.
